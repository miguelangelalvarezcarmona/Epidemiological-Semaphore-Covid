# Epidemiological-Semaphore-Covid
The semaphore prediction consists of determining the Mexican Epidemiological Semaphore through the covid news in Mexico. The epidemiological semaphore, among other things, allows the activities for the tourism sector. It is a system of four ordered colors: red, orange, yellow, and green, where red is the most restrictive, and green is the most permissive. The color of the semaphore changes weekly and is independent in each state of the Mexican Republic. This color is determined by the government taking into account various factors such as the capacity of hospitals, the contagion and death curve, available ventilators, among others. Coincidentally, these factors are shared through the news of each state. If it is possible to predict the color of the epidemiological semaphore in advance, this will allow sellers and tourism service providers to take preventive measures.
